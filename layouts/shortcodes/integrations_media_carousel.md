A media carousel of images and a video is included in your integration tile.

Technology Partners can add a video to an integration tile. Do not upload the video in your pull request. Instead, send a copy or a download link of your video to <a href="mailto:marketplace@datadoghq.com">marketplace@datadoghq.com</a>. The Marketplace team replies with a `vimeo_link` which you can add in the `manifest.json` file to include the video in the media carousel.

The video must meet the following requirements:

| Video Requirements | Description                                                                           |
