Once you have created a `README.md` file, add the following sections as H2s (`##`) and fill out the content that is displayed in the Marketplace tile:

| Header Name | Header |
|-------------|--------|
| Overview | Write a description under an `## Overview` header that describes the value your offering provides to users and benefits to purchasing and installing the integration in the Datadog Marketplace (for example, out-of-the-box dashboards, replays of user sessions, logs, alerts, and more). <br><br>This information is displayed in the **Overview** tab on the integration tile. |
| Setup | Include all the steps to setting up your Marketplace integration that includes information divided into H3 headings (`###`). Standard topics include:<br><br>- Installing the integration using the in-app integration tile. <br>- Configuring the integration with the appropriate roles and permissions in your Datadog organization.<br>- Accessing out-of-the-box Datadog features that users who purchased and installed the integration can access (such as metrics, events, monitors, logs, dashboards, and more).|
| Uninstallation | Include all the steps to uninstalling your Marketplace integration. This information is displayed in the **Configure** tab on the integration tile.|
| Data Collected  | Specify the types of data collected by your Marketplace integration that includes information about out-of-the-box metrics, events, or service checks. <br><br>You can include additional types of data collected such as logs, monitors, dashboards, and more. If your Marketplace integration does not provide any of these, you do not need to add a Data Collected section. |
| Support | Provide contact information that includes an email to your Support team, a phone number to your company, a link to your company's documentation or blog post, and more help information in a bulleted list format. |
