Security profiles provide a baseline of a workload's typical behavior in order to surface unusual activity. They provide additional workload behavior context when investigating security signals, and are also used to generate [suppression suggestions](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggested-actions) for signals that match known workload behavior.

To generate security profiles, you must [enable activity snapshots][4] in the Agent. Activity snapshots capture all kernel-level activity in your containers in 30 minute intervals.

**Question**: I need help describing the steps taken by CWS to generate the security profiles after/while capturing activity snapshots. I also could use some help describing what consistutes a given security profile - image version, multiple security dumps, the role the machine learning model plays in continuously generating the security profile, etc.

## Machine learning model

Description of machine learning model, how it works, etc.

- How long it takes for a model to go from **Learning** to **Stable**.
- How many times does the model run for each security profile? Every time an activity snapshot is merged into the profile?

## Explore security profiles

Security profiles generated by CWS are displayed on the [Security Profiles][2] page, grouped by image name. Click an image name to see the full list of security profiles associated with the image. Details shown for each security profile include the number of activity dumps that were merged to create the profile, the status of the machine learning model, and the date on which the profile was last updated.

Select a security profile to view its details page. Explore the processes that make up the security profile, view related security signals, containers tagged with the image name, and the activity dumps that were used to create the profile.

The **Behavior Commonality** score at the top of the page shows how common the activity is across all workload instances monitored. In general, the higher the commonality score, the more likely that a given process or file activity is normal, known behavior. Scores may fluctuate over time as more workloads are merged into the profile, or the composition of the individual workloads change over time.

Select a process node to view additional details on the side panel. This includes a commonality score for the process based on how common the files and requests in the process activity are across all workload instances monitored.

Security profile details also appear in the signal panel in the [Security Signals Explorer][3]. You can use this information to help distinguish between potential threats and normal workload behavior. If the security profile matches known workload behavior, a [suppression suggestion](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggestions) is displayed.

## Suppress signals based on suggestions

If a signal matches known workload behavior for a security profile, a suppression suggestion is displayed on the security signal side panel. You can view the corresponding security profile and the process triggering the signal before choosing whether to accept the suggestion.

To accept the suggestion, click **Suppress Signals**, then click **Add Suppression to Rule**. This creates a suppression query for the rule that excludes the process from triggering future security signals.
