Security profiles...

With this information, CWS generates [suppression suggestions](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggested-actions).

Security profiles provide a baseline a workload's typical behavior in order to surface unusual activity.

- Allows you to view how common...
- Generate a baseline of known behavior using a continuous learning model.
- Search and filter for individual workloads using workload parameters and infrastructure service tags.
- Provide additional context when remediating Cloud Workload Security signals
- Associate security profiles to provide additional workload behavior context when investigating security signals.
- Link to full security profile details from within the signal view to distinguish between potential threats and normal workload behavior.

auto generated once you have enabled activity dumps in the agent. There are settings on how many workload containers are profiled at the same time (default: 3) and for what period of time (default: 30 minutes). These parameters will be configurable via the UI in the next release update. There will be no ability for customers to create their own security profile. This is behavior learning so we are capturing what the workload is actually doing across all similar workloads in the customer environment.

Datadog Cloud Security Management reduces an organization's alerting signal-to-noise ratio by using Workload Security Profiles, which create a baseline out of a workload's typical behavior in order to surface unusual activity. For example, an attacker may attempt to launch a new cron job on a host in order to execute malicious code. Datadog Cloud Security Management can automatically flag this kind of activity as suspicious behavior in the Security Overview Page.

Security Profiles provide an opportunity to simplify this process by applying suppressions validated against current workload behavior.

## Suppress signals based on suggested actions

On the Signals page,

view security profile
view activity detail
suppress signals

- click suppress signals button to open new dialog box. Create a suppression query

If a suppression isn't generated...

If the signal does not match any known security profile, <-- Maybe should go with "Explore Security Profiles" section...

**Add Suppression to Rule**.

## Adjust security profiles settings

Not yet available for testing.

- enable/disable suppression suggestions
- suppression suggestions threshold

Context: Customers must be able to choose (at a granular level) which features of security profiles they want to enable/disable. For example, you disable the suppression suggestions, but keep the ML model turned on. The security profiles generated by the ML model can still help customers with their investigations.
