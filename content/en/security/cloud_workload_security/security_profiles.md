Security profiles provide a baseline of a workload's typical behavior in order to surface unusual activity. Each security profile is generated from the merge of multiple activity dumps.

Generated from multiple activity dumps, they provide additional workload behavior context when investigating security signals. With this information, CWS also generates [suppression suggestions](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggested-actions) for signals that meet the suppression suggestion threshold.

Security profiles use machine learning algorithms to provide a baseline of the typical behavior found in your workloads in order to surface unusual activity. They provide additional workload behavior context when investigating security signals. With this information, CWS also generates [suppression suggestions](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggested-actions) for signals that meet the suppression suggestion threshold.

Cloud Workload Security (CWS) security profiles uses machine learning algorithms to create security profiles that provide a baseline of the typical behavior found in your workloads in order to surface unusual activity. They provide additional workload behavior context when investigating security signals. With this information, CWS also generates [suppression suggestions](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggested-actions) for signals that meet the suppression suggestion threshold.

Each security profile is generated from the merge of multiple activity dumps.

CWS automatically generates security profiles

- Allows you to view how common...
- Generate a baseline of known behavior using a continuous learning model.
- Search and filter for individual workloads using workload parameters and infrastructure service tags.

auto generated once you have enabled activity dumps in the agent.

Security Profiles provide an opportunity to simplify this process by applying suppressions validated against current workload behavior.

## Security Profiles

Description of security profiles, how they work, how they are generated, etc.

CWS Security Profiles aggregate system calls, network behavior, and file access from many hosts to model what is normal for a specific service. This allows customers to review and validate the behavior of their services. Profiles are designed to surface deviation from known behavior ("anomaly detection") and to facilitate the suppression specific kinds of security signalsvalidated by customers as benign ("agent-side suppression").

## Machine learning model

Description of machine learning model, how it works, etc.

- How long it takes for a model to go from **Learning** to **Stable**.
- Does the model run once per security profile?

## Explore security profiles

Security profiles generated by CWS are displayed on the [Security Profiles][1] page, grouped by image name. Click an image name to see the full list of security profiles associated with the image. Details shown for each security profile include the number of activity dumps that were merged to create the profile, the status of the machine learning model, and the date on which the profile was last updated.

Select a security profile to view its details page. Use the interactive explorer to **DO X, Y, AND Z - graph connecting file and process nodes?**, view related security signals, containers tagged with the image name, and the activity dumps that were used to create the profile.

The **Behavior Commonality** score at the top of the page shows how common the activity is across all workload instances monitored. In general, the higher the commonality score, the more likely that a given process or file activity is normal, known behavior. Scores may fluctuate over time as more workloads are merged into the profile, or the composition of the individual workloads change over time.

When you select a node in the interactive explorer, additional details are displayed on the side panel. This includes a commonality score for **the Y**.

Security profile details also appear in the signal panel in the [Security Signals Explorer][2]. You can use this information to help distinguish between potential threats and normal workload behavior. If the security profile matches known workload behavior, a [suppression suggestion](#suppress-signals-based-on-suggestions) is displayed.

## Suppress signals based on suggestions

If a signal matches known workload behavior for a security profile, a suppression suggestion is displayed on the security signal side panel. You can view the security profile that triggered the suggestion, and the **X (view activity detail button)** before choosing whether to accept the suggestion.

To accept the suggestion, click **Suppress Signals**, then click **Add Suppression to Rule**. This creates a suppression query for the rule that excludes the process from triggering future security signals.

## Adjust security profiles settings

Not yet available for testing.

- enable/disable suppression suggestions
- suppression suggestions threshold

Context: Customers must be able to choose (at a granular level) which features of security profiles they want to enable/disable. For example, you disable the suppression suggestions, but keep the ML model turned on. The security profiles generated by the ML model can still help customers with their investigations.
